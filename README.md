Final Report and Data Analyses

All R code is found in the Term_Project_Code folder

Be weary that this code is not nice and I did it very quickly over a couple of days really.
The data would be very hard to reproduce simply because I combined R Code and Excel functions to 
compile and format my data faster.

If you want to reproduce my answers you only need to run the "final_proj_analysis.R" file.
This has all of the relevant data you need and will give the same results that I put in my
report. All the other R code was related to formatting data or graphing.

All in all this data was actually pretty good, could just be formatted better.


The folder "mksc.2021.1321" is the data and Stata analyses done by Sim, Cho, Hwang, and Telang.
This data is older than mine but also has more information.
This folder also has a PDF of the paper done by Sim, Cho, Hwang, and Telang. I would recommend
reading it as it was pretty interesting (to me at least).
